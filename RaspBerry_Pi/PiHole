Purpose: Harden the home lab network by filtering DNS traffic.

  Deployed in Docker using docker-compose.yml.

  Blocks ad/tracker domains network-wide, improving speed & reducing telemetry noise.

  Provides visibility into outbound DNS queries from IoT devices & VMs.

Learning outcome:

  Configured and tuned blocklists to balance usability vs. protection.

  Practiced monitoring DNS queries to identify suspicious traffic patterns.

### Follow along:

If this is the first time booting up the raspberry pi, be sure to update it to the latest software.

- Install Docker and compose:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker <your-username>
sudo apt install -y docker-compose-plugin
'''

- Create a directory to house pihole files and create the yml file:

'''bash 
mkdir ~/pihole && cd ~/pihole
nano docker-compose.yml
'''

after this PiHole is ready to be spun up and you should be able to access your admin dashboard, making adjustments as neccesary.
For testing purposes you should first test this with a singular device before re-directing all network traffic through it.
Also fair warning make sure you have a backup dns server address if you plan on shutting down the pihole.
