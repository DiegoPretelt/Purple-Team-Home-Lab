## Purpose
This repository contains educational C programs demonstrating classic memory safety vulnerabilities,
including buffer overflows and control-flow hijacking, implemented in controlled lab environments.

The goal is to understand how these vulnerabilities work in order to design and validate defensive
controls such as stack canaries, ASLR, and safe coding practices.

## Disclaimer
All code in this repository is intended for educational use only and was developed and tested in
isolated lab environments. It should not be used against systems without explicit authorization.
