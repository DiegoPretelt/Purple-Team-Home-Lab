For my attacking machine here is how I set up everything:

 1. Download Kali Linux (Virtual Image)

at: https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines

Download the Kali Linux VirtualBox (64-bit) .7z archive

2. Extract the Archive

- locate the folder in a place you remeber (you will probably have to make some modifications)
- Use the built in extraction tools to get the contents of the zip file
- You’ll get .vbox and .vdi files
- these are ready for VirtualBox (no need for anything right now)

3. Import Kali image into VirtualBox

- Open VirtualBox
- Go to ADD
- Select the .vbox file from the downloaded folder to import the machine

4. Configure VM Settings (this step is optional but recommended)

- RAM: At least 2–4 GB
- CPU: 2 or more if possible
- Video Memory: 128 MB
- Network: NAT or Bridged (for external connections)

5. Start the VM

- Username: kali
- Password: kali

- First thing we want to do as soon as we get access is change the default credentials
- passwd kali (to change passwords for default account)

- We also want to change the root default password much like before:
- passwd root

6. Update the System (Shouldn't matter too much right now, but will in the future)

- sudo apt update

7. Install other tools and wordlists

- Kali offers a very large diverse suite of tools, so experiment and find what you like
- this part is mostly subjective to what you decide to use the machine for 
- I decided to get seclists which is a very large collection of lists for different use cases
- sudo apt install seclists

8. Play Around with VirtualBox Settings:

- There are many settings available for each VM and there are multiple settings worth checking out
- I for one had to change my Hosts key as I don't have a right ctrl key
- adjusting window sizes, playing with different shortcuts and many others

That should be it, and now you have a fully functioning virtualized attacker machine, use with caution!
