I chose to use an AWS EC2 instance to host my Wazuh Server:

- I did this EC2 deployment using the free tier offered by AWS
- the OS is ubuntu server
- instance type t3.micro (Intended use as home lab)
- locally stored key pair for SSH into instance

- NETWORK settings:
  - only allowing SSH traffic from my IP (not recommended to allow port 22 access from everywhere)
  - port 443 also gets enabled for HTTPS traffic 
  - also added some special rules for the Wazuh agents to be able to be deployed and communicate with the server

Port	Protocol	Purpose
22	  TCP	      SSH access to manage the server
443	  TCP	      Wazuh dashboard (HTTPS UI)
1514	TCP/UDP	  Agent to Manager log forwarding
55000	TCP	      Agent enrollment/registration

- STORAGE CONFIGURATION:
  - reccommended at least 20 GiBs of gp3 storage to be able to run Wazuh Server
  - At the time of writing anything under 30 still qualifies under the free tier
  - rest of the advanced settings were left as default

- This instance is now ready to be deployed

- COMMANDS TO RUN AND DOWNLOAD WAZUH SERVER:
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.8/wazuh-install.sh
sudo bash wazuh-install.sh -a -i
